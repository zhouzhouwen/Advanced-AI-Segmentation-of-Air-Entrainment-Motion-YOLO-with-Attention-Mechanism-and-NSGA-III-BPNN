HIGHLIGHT
1. A state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) method based on an YOLOV5 with attention mechanism and NSGA-III-BPNN was developed to fully automatically segment the air entrainment motion.
2. The accuracy and robustness of the developed AI method were demonstrated in predicting the penetration depth of air entrainment and classifying the different shape regimes of air entrainment.

ABSTRACT
Understanding air entrainment phenomena caused by plunging water jets is crucial in nuclear and hydraulic engineering. This process involves the depth and width of bubble penetration and the vertical positioning of the bubble plume, which are key safety design parameters for thermal-hydraulic systems. Current research on predicting these parameters is limited, primarily relying on empirical correlations or predictive models for bubble penetration depth. However, there is no consensus on the appropriate calculation principles for varying conditions of plunging jets. This study develops an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approach, integrating an improved YOLOV5 with an attention mechanism and NSGA-III-BPNN, to automatically detect and segment air entrainment motion across a broad range of conditions with high scalability and robustness. This method not only extracts real-time bubble penetration depth and air entrainment motion but also significantly improves accuracy over conventional empirical correlations. Furthermore, it efficiently classifies shape regimes based on real-time air entrainment motion, surpassing conventional post-processing methods. The proposed AI-based method holds promise as a potential substitute for conventional empirical methods and the segmentation data obtained from AI is beneficial for the development and calibration of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) algorithms. This advancement could pave the way for broader applications of AI within the realm of thermal hydraulics.
